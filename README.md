## ATM

In this exercise I created an ATM that displays your account balance, allows you to deposit and withdraw money from your account but does not allow you to withdraw more money than you have in your account.  If you try than you will recieve an error mesaage.  I also have a function that doesnt allow you to enter zero or a neagative number as an amount.

Future improvments to this exercise is to add ATM features like quick withdrawal and a receipt option.

You can run this exercise by cloning it and running it on a local http server.
